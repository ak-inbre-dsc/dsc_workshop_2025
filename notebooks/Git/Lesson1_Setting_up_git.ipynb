    "\n",
    "> *Line Endings*\n",
    "Windows uses Carriage Return + Line Feed (CRLF, or \\r\\n) Linux and macOS use Line Feed (LF, or \\n) If these are not handled correctly, you can end up with files that look like they have extra characters or line breaks when viewed on a different operating system, leading to unnecessary \"changes\" detected by Git.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Linux/macOS environments (like your Google Cloud instance), the recommended setting for core.autocrlf is input. Git converts CRLF to LF when you commit files to the repository. When you check out files, Git does not convert LF back to CRLF. This is ideal for Linux/macOS users working with Windows users, as it ensures that LF is always stored in the repository. **Don't worry if this is too technical for you. You don't need to fully understand it to continue with our tutorial.**"
