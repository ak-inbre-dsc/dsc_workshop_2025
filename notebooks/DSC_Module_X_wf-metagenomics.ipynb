    "## **Workflow Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "The *wf-metagenomics* workflow provides a comprehensive analysis of metagenomic data. Here's an outline of the key stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Data:**  \n",
    "   * The workflow accepts sequencing data in FASTQ or BAM format, which are standard formats for storing raw sequencing reads.  \n",
    "   * The input data represents the mixed genetic material from the microbial community under investigation.  \n",
    "2. **Taxonomic Classification:**  \n",
    "   * The core function of this workflow is to determine the taxonomic composition of the sample. It employs two main approaches:  \n",
    "     * **Kraken 2:** This method assigns taxonomic labels to DNA sequences by examining their k-mers (short DNA sequences of length k) and comparing them against a database of known k-mers. It's known for its speed and accuracy in identifying the likely source organism of a given sequence.  \n",
    "     * **Minimap2:** This method aligns the sequencing reads against a reference database of microbial genomes. By determining the best match for each read, Minimap2 can infer the organism it originated from.  \n",
    "   * Users can choose between these two methods based on their specific needs and the characteristics of their data.  \n",
    "3. **Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Detection (Optional):**  \n",
    "   * The workflow can also identify genes associated with antimicrobial resistance within the metagenomic data.  \n",
    "   * This is typically done by comparing the sequencing reads against databases of known AMR genes.  \n",
    "   * Detecting AMR genes provides insights into the potential presence of drug-resistant microbes in the sample.  \n",
    "4. **Output and Reporting:**  \n",
    "   * The workflow generates a comprehensive report summarizing the metagenomic analysis. This report typically includes:  \n",
    "     * Taxonomic profiles: Interactive visualizations and tables showing the abundance and distribution of different taxa in the sample.  \n",
    "     * AMR gene identification: If enabled, a list of detected AMR genes and their associated organisms.  \n",
    "     * Quality control metrics: Statistics about the sequencing data, such as read lengths and quality scores.\n"
