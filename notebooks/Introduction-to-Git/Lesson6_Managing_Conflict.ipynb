    "In collaborative development, it's common for two or more people to modify the *same part of the same file* simultaneously. When Git tries to combine these divergent changes, it can't automatically decide which version to keep. This is called a **merge conflict**.\n",
    "\n",

    "**The Scenario:**\n",
    "* Both Owner and Collaborator will start by making sure their local `main` branch is completely up-to-date with the shared remote.\n",
    "* **Owner** will then create a feature branch and modify a specific line in `my_code.R`, commit it, and push it to `main`.\n",
    "* **Collaborator** will *also* create a feature branch, and modify the *exact same line* in `my_code.R` with a *different* change.\n",
    "* When Collaborator tries to merge their changes into `main` (after Owner has already pushed theirs), a conflict will occur.\n",
