excerpt: "This is the starting point for my new website on GitHub Pages, powered by Jekyll."
Hello, GitHub Pages!
Welcome to my brand new website. I'm excited to share my thoughts and projects here.

This site is built using Jekyll, a static site generator, and hosted for free on GitHub Pages.

Why Jekyll?
Jekyll allows me to:

Write content in Markdown, which is super easy to learn and use.

Use templates to keep my site consistent without repeating code.

Benefit from a fast and secure website because it's purely static.

Deploy easily with GitHub's built-in support.

Getting Started
You can edit this index.md file to change your homepage content.
To add new blog posts, create Markdown files in the _posts folder following the YYYY-MM-DD-title.md format.

Feel free to explore the _config.yml file to customize your site's title, description, and other settings.

Happy building!
